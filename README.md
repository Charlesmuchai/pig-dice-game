#### By Ian Muchai

## Description

Ian's Pig Dice Game is a game that can either be played by two players or one player. The game rules are on my page.
Some of the rules are:
If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
